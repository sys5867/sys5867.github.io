	<h1>Text-to-music Generator : 20160347 Sim Yusung</h1>
	<h1>Introduction</h1>
	<p>This is explanation for Final Project of KAIST CTP431:Music and Audio Computing, 2017 Fall semester. text-to-music generator. It generates rhythm and melody from typed-in text. You can also adjust some settings for parameters of generator.  
	</p>
	<h1>Motivation</h1>
	<p>This semester, I took a lecture 'Formal Languages and Automata', which I learned about parser and languages. What I thought is that music is also a language that people presents there feeling, so what if I can convert text into music? So I decied to make text-to-music generator for the final projects.
	</p>
	<h1>Preparation Research</h1>
	<p><a href="http://audiocrawl.co/crawl/typatone-be43">Typatone</a> is a Webaudio project that maps each key typing into a single sound, and then loops a melody generated by typed text. It's very simple and good idea that a note is mapped to a letter.
	</p>
	<p><a href="http://alestsurko.by/microscale/">Microscale</a> is a Webaudio project that catches pattern from long text, such as wikipedia page, and generates melody pattern for predefine rythm and chords. Making patterns from given text is one of ideas I chose for my project.
	</p>
	<h1>Project Page</h1>
	<div class="container"><div class="col-md-6" style="padding-left: 0px;">

    <p>The project page is <a href="index.html">Here.</a> You can also access by clicking 'Text to Music Generator' at navbar.
    </p>
	</div>
	<h1>Implementation</h1>
	<p>The generator thinks each line as one pattern for fixed length of bars, like in step sequencer. Then it will try to change patterns in the text line to pattern of notes.</p>

	<p>For rhythm, kick, snare, and hat is used. Snare pattern is fixed for 2, 4 offbeat.</p>

	<p>Kick pattern is generated from the first line. It extracts 8 words from line. For each words, if the word starts with consonant, a kick note is pushed, Otherwise, it does not.</p>

	<p>Hat pattern is generated from the second line. It will see length of word behind the vowel and if it's long enought, it will push a hat note.</p>

	<p>For bass notes, the chord is fixed as Dm7-G7-CM7-FM7. By the frequency of bass notes, it will generate rock bass pttern of the chords.</p>

	<p>For melody notes, The note's pitch position will be moved according to vowel. If vowel is easier to speak, (for instance, a and e), then the moveement increase. Else, the movement is restricted. Then, for melody note frequency, if the word is longer than some parameter, the melody note is pushed. Else, it's not pushed. By this, the frequency of playing notes can be determined. Finally, for adjusting melody to chord tones, generator tries to adjust a pitch of note, by some period determined by the parameter. Chord tones of each chord is fixed, so generator can find closest chord tone and then change to it.</p>

	<h1>Futher Improvements</h1>
	<p>There are many things to improve for this project. First, there are some bugs with parsing text, like unhandled behavior for specific length of text. The most important improvement should be improving the text parser and making it more modulized.</p>
	<p>For now, the chord progression is fixed. Because it was very hard to generate chords that musically make sense, better generator should have modulized generator for chord progressions. Also, making melodies that fits well with the chord is also a hard job to do. So for further improvements the melody generator should be implemented and modulized.</p>
